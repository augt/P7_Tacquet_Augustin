# P7 - Groupomania

## Description :

This is the last project of my training program at OpenClassrooms. The goal was to build both the back-end and the front-end of a simplified social network, aimed at facilitating team building in a dummy company called "Groupomania".
The technical constraints were to use node.js, express an SQL based database, and the use of a front-end javascript framework was mandatory.
