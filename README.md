# P7 - Groupomania

### Description :

This is the last project of my training program at OpenClassrooms. The goal was to build both the back-end and the front-end of a simplified social network, aimed at facilitating team building in an imaginary company called "Groupomania".

The technical constraints were to use node.js, express, an SQL based database, and the use of a front-end javascript framework was mandatory.

I chose to make use of **React** for the front-end and my database is based on **SQLite**, which I use with the help of the **Sequelize** ORM. The use of SQLite allows me to store my database in my code repo, which facilitates testing the admin/moderator account functionalities for anyone willing to clone and test out my projet. For demonstation purposes, the email adress of the admin account is `admin@mail.fr` and it's password is `Password1`.
